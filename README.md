# Simple 2d car physics with JavaScript!

Use keyboard (up, down, left, right) or touch screen (swipe up, down, left, right)

All code [here](https://github.com/pakastin/car/blob/master/car.js)! Not real car physics, but a simple way to do nice little drifting ðŸ˜›

Skidmarks are rendered with canvas and car is just a simple DIV element.
